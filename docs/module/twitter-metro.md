The Twitter Metro Module provides access to the Twitter Search API. Granted access is to read data only!

```
The main set-up is provided as part of the service for Sigma-DS Cloud hosted customers. Please follow the simplified process below to connect to the Twitter API.

- Select Modules from the Administration section of the menu.
- Click on the row menu for the Twitter Provider (Twitter Search) Module and select Connect to Twitter.
- A form will open which has a Login with Twitter button which allows authorisation for the CMS to connect via a Twitter account.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to authorise.
Skip the installation section below and go straight to the Add Widget section.
```

## Installation

Access to the Twitter API is protected and so users must register for an API key which is then entered into the Twitter Metro Module in the Sigma-DS CMS.

### Connecting to Twitter

- Obtain an API key and API secret from Twitter and then log in to your Twitter account.
  Please note: You will need to apply for a Twitter developer account if you are not already approved, using the above Twitter link.

- Complete the required fields and accept the Terms of Service.
- Solve the CAPTCHA and submit the form.
- Make a note of the generated consumer key (API key) and consumer secret (API secret).

### Twitter Metro Module Installation

- Select the Modules page under the Administration section and install the Twitter Metro Module.
- Once installed click on the row menu for the Twitter Metro Module and click Edit.
- Enter the generated API key and API secret.
- Optionally adjust the Cache Period to determine how long to cache a results set for each Twitter search.

```
Setting a low value can cause your access to the Twitter API to be disabled for generating too many requests.
```

## Add Widget

Locate Twitter Metro from the Widget toolbar and click to Add or Grab to drag and drop to a Region.

```
NOTE: If you are using a 1.8.x CMS, select Twitter Metro from the Widget Toolbox to add!
