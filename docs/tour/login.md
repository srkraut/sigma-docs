## Logging in

The CMS is protected by an authentication system that requires a Username and Password.

During the installation process, a Username and Password is provided which grants unrestricted access to all areas of the CMS, as a top level Super Admin User. Once logged in additional User accounts can be created with various levels of access, as covered in the Users section of this manual.

All pages in the CMS are authenticated and if the User is not logged a login form will appear.

## First time access

Administrators (Super Admin Users) After installation the Username and Password provided during installation must be used to access the CMS as a Super Administrator.

## Users

Users can be created by Administrators and given access to the system. The Username and Password for any new User should be shared in a private and secure manner. We highly recommend that the User changes their password after first time log in.

## Two Factor Authentication

Two Factor Authentication can be set by Users for added security. Once configured a User would need to enter a code sent via email or displayed in the Google Authenticator app to complete login and gain access to the CMS.
