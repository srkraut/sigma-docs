# Templates

Templates are saved copies of designed Layouts which can then be used when creating new Layouts. Using a template can speed up the design process and is a good way to ensure that a corporate image/standard is maintained.

## Creating a Template

Templates can be created two ways:

1. Adding directly from the Templates page

2. Saving an existing Layout as a Template

## 1. Add Layout from Template Page

- Click on Templates under the Design section of the main menu
- Select the Add Template button and complete the appropriate form fields.

- Templates an be optionally saved to Folders for easier searches, organisation and to easily set Share options for Users/User Groups.

```
Templates that are saved in Folders will inherit the View, Edit, Delete Share options that have been applied to the destination Folder for that User/User Group.
If users should also have access to the content of the Template, ensure that this is also saved to the same Folder!

```

- Provide a Name for easy identification purposes within the CMS.

- Include optional Tags to organise and make it easier to search for.

- Select the Resolution to be used for this Template/Layout.

Templates/Layouts are designed for an intended display Resolution and will function best when shown on a Player with a matching resolution. If they are shown on a display that has a different resolution it will dynamically resize which may result in unused screen space.

```
Sending a Player a Layout that has been designed with a 4:3 resolution which is connected to a 16:9 TV screen would result in two empty bars either side of your content.
```

- Provide a Name for easy identification purposes within the CMS.

- On saving the form, the Layout Designer will automatically open.

## 2. Saving a Layout as a Template

A Published Layout can be saved as a Template from the Layout Designer by using the status menu and selecting Save Template:

```
Layouts can also be saved as Templates by using the Row Menu for a Layout in the Layouts Grid and selecting Save Template!
```

Complete all relevant form fields to save the selected Layout as a Template:

- Use Select Folder to move from the shown Current Folder Location.
- Give the Template an identifiable Name so that Users can easily select from the Template drop down when adding Layouts.
- Assign Tags if required.
- Provide an optional description/explanation/instructions to other users of this Template.
- Use the tick box to include all Widgets that have been added to the Layout to be included in the Template.
- Save
  Once saved, Templates can be managed from the Templates grid.

Each Template has additional actions/shortcuts that can be accessed from the row menu.
