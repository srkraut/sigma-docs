# Layout Timeline

Each Region on a Layout has its own Playlist of content, which is shown in a specified order by a Player.

A Playlist can consist of a single item (such as a company logo), or multiple items (such as an image slideshow).

A Regionâ€™s Playlist is viewed/edited in the Timeline in the Layout Designer:

The timeline clearly shows how each Regions assigned Widgets will play. The greyed out entries indicate what will play when that items own duration is exceeded.

The window to the left of the Region gives a preview of the Region positioning on the Layout.
