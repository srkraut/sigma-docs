# Library Search

The Toolbar contains multiple Library Search options to give users an easy way to assign media which already exists in the Library to Layouts and Playlists.

- Select from Image, Audio, Video or ‘other media’ files to open:

Images/videos that are selected from Pixabay to be used in Layouts will automatically be added to your Library!

Library Media can also be added to a Region as a Playlist view by clicking on the menu to the right of the Timeline:

```
Delete multiple items on the playlist using the purple Select Multiple Widgets button in the toolbar and then clicking on media in the timeline to select. Click the bin icon to remove all selections.
```

- Exit the Playlist view by closing down the Playlist window.

## Upload new

New files can be uploaded from the Toolbar to be used directly in Layouts and saved to the Library.

- Open a Library Search for Image/Audio or Video and select Upload new and add to a Region:

![Alt text](library11.png)
The file uploader will open on adding:
![Alt text](library12.png)

- Click on Add files and select the file(s) to upload.

```
We recommend the following file formats:
Audio - mp3.wav
Image - jpg,jpeg,png,bmp,gif (Animated gif’s are not supported on any Player).
Video - H264 MP4
```

Give your file a Name for easier identification in the CMS and an optional Tag.

```
If the Name field is left blank, the file will be named as per the original file name on upload!
```

Files can be optionally saved to Folders for easier searches, organisation and to easily set Share options for Users/User Groups.

```
Files that are saved in Folders will inherit the View, Edit, Delete Share options that have been applied to the destination Folder for User/User Group access!
```

## Expiry Dates

Media uploaded directly to Layouts have the option to Set Expiry Dates
![Alt text](library112.png)

```
This is particularly useful should you need to preload media to be shown at a later date/time!
```

- Tick the Set Expiry Dates box.
  ![Alt text](library113.png)
- Select Start and End dates and times.

- Use the check boxes to remove the media file from the Playlist on expiry and delete from the Library.

- Click the Start upload button to begin the upload of all files added. If a Folder/Expiry Dates have been selected and there are multiple files to be added, all files will be uploaded to the specified location and have the same Expiry Dates set.

- Once successfully uploaded, click Done.

Files can also be uploaded individually and have different Folder locations/Expiry dates and times specified. Instead of clicking on the Start upload button, click on the blue upload button shown at the end of the row for an added file.

Change the Folder location using the Select Folder button as before and then click the blue button at the end of the row to upload just that singular file.
