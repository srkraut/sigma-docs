# Playlists

Playlists are reusable lists of content that are created and managed independently to Layouts. Once created, Playlists are added to Layouts using the Sub-Playlist Widget

# Feature Overview:

- Easily create a ‘slide-show’ of content.
- Re-use across multiple Layouts.
- Define content order.
- Add and maintain content dynamically.
- Update content without accessing Layouts.
- Add multiple Playlists to Layouts using the Sub-Playlist Widget.

Streamline resources and save time by creating Playlists to hold multiple items of content which can be used across multiple Layouts. Create Playlists to target and collate content for specific requirements, locations, categories etc.

Playlists are created and managed independently to Layouts and therefore do not require further user access to Layouts or the Layout Designer to add or manage content. Edits made to a Playlist will update all Sub-Playlist Widgets on Layouts that the Playlist has been added to.

# Creating a Playlist

Playlists are administered from the Playlists page under the Library section of the main CMS menu:

- Playlists can be optionally saved to Folders for easier searches, organisation and to set Share options for Users/User Groups.

```
Folders provide an easy way to define User/User Group access to its contents.
 Playlists will inherit any Share access that have been applied to the destination Folder.
Please note: If a User/User Group should also require access to any media files
 added to the Playlist, they would also need to be added to the Folder!

```

- Name your Playlist for easy identification for when it needs to be selected in the Sub-Playlist Widget.

- Include optional Tags to further organise and locate.

# Dynamically adding Media

Playlists have a Dynamic option to automatically assign Library Media files based on set criteria:

- Tick to enable the automatic management of assigning media to the Playlist.
- Once ticked, click on the Filter tab and set the required criteria in order to populate matching Library Media.
- Provide a maximum number of Library Media files which can be automatically assigned.

Media already in the Library that matches the criteria set will show here.

Any future media files that are added to the Library that satisfy the set criteria for this Playlist will be automatically added to this list.

```
Library Media can also be prepopulated as a one-time assignment to a Playlist by setting criteria but leaving the Dynamic option unticked!
```

# Manually adding Media

To manually add media to Playlists, Save the new record form without ticking the Dynamic option to open the Playlist Editor.
