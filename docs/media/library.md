# Library

Pixabay images and videos that are selected to be used on Layouts/Playlists are also added to the Library!
```

Library media is managed from Media under the Library section of the main menu:

## Adding Media

```
Files can also be added via drag and drop!
```

- Give your file a Name for easier identification in the CMS and an optional Tag.

```
If the Name field is left blank, the file will be named as per the original file name on upload!
```

Media can also be directly uploaded to a specified Folder location.

```
Media files that are saved in Folders will inherit the View, Edit, Delete Share option that have been applied to the destination Folder for User/User Group access!
```

```

- Click in the Folder you wish to upload the file to and click Done.

- The Current Folder will now show the selected file path.

- Click the Start upload button to begin the upload of all files. If a Folder has been selected and you have added multiple files, all files will be uploaded to that location.

Files can also be uploaded individually and have different Folder locations specified. Instead of clicking on the Start upload button, click on the blue upload button shown at the end of the row for an added file.

- Change the Folder location using the Select Folder button as before and then click the blue button at the end of the row to upload just that singular file.

```
Media files can also be uploaded directly to Layouts using the upload tool from the Library Search function for Images, Audio and Video files. Other file types (such as PDF) can be uploaded by adding the associated Widget to a Layout. Files that are added directly to Layouts are saved by default to the Library.
```

## Add Media via URL

  ![Alt text](library4.png)
- Use the Select Folder button if you need to select /create a specific Folder to add this media file to.
- Provide the remote URL for the file.
- Include a Name to be used instead of the file name if required for easier identification in the system.
- Click to Save.

## Upload Fonts

It comes with a set of standard fonts provided by our text editor tool - CKEditor, which are currently:

- Aileron Heavy Regular (Aileron-Heavy.otf)
- Aileron Regular (Aileron-Regular.otf)
- Dancing Script Regular (DancingScript-Regular.ttf)
- Railway Regular (Railway.ttf)
- Linear Regular (linear-by-braydon-fuller.otf)

Additional fonts can be added to the Library using the uploader tool. Once added, the font will be available to use in the text editor.

```
If the new font does not show in the text editor after upload, try clearing the browser cache! Please note: Fonts have preferences built into then known as OS/2 tags. Xibo checks for OS/2 preferences and can use fonts with OS/2 tags 0 or 8. Fonts with other OS/2 tags may produce an error on uploading and may not display correctly.
```

Each item in the Library has a row menu where users can access a list of actions/shortcuts
