The Menu Boards interface provides a simple way for users to create and configure information to be used with the Menu Board Widget to display Menu items and information using customisable templates.

Menu Boards allow for the creation of ‘reusable Menus’ which are created and managed independantly to Layouts. Once created, Menus can easily be reused across multiple Layouts.

Using Menu Boards is a two part process:

- The Menu Board - contains the content of the Menu
- The Menu Board Widget - allows for configuration of the Menu
  Menu Boards are administered by clicking on Menu Boards under the Library section of the main menu:

The Menu Boards Grid allows users to create new and edit existing.

Click the Folders icon to toggle on/off from view.

```
When Folders are hidden from view, the file path for the selected folder will be shown!
```

- Click on a Folder/sub-folder to search the contents and return results based on any filters applied to the grid.
  or

- Tick All Folders to include searching in the Root Folder and return results based on any filters applied to the grid.

Once all information has been completed, add the Menu Board Widget to a Layout using the Layout Designer and complete configuration options to best present the information.

```
Menu Boards are edited independently to Layouts, so there is no need
to accessor edit the Layout(s) the Menu Board has been added to.
 Changes will be available in the system straight away ready to be
 picked up by Players on their next collection, with no need to make any edits to Layouts!
```
