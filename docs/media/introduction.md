# Media

We support a wide variety of Media which can be categorised into 2 different types:

1. Library Media
2. Layout Media

## Library Media

Library Media is file-based Media that is uploaded and stored in the CMS Library for use on one or multiple Layouts.

```
From v3.1.0 integration with Pixaby allows for Images and Videos to be selected
 when adding content to Layouts using Library Searches.
  Selections will be automatically added to the Library!
```

Examples of Library Media are:

- Images
- Videos
- Fonts
  Library Media is administered from Media under the Library section of the Menu.

```
DataSets and Menu Boards are a special type of Library Media which are used to represent tabular data.
```

## Layout Media

Layout Media is created and stored directly on a Layout. This Media cannot be reused and exists on only 1 Playlist specific to a particular Layout.

Examples of Layout Media are:

- Text
- Ticker
- Embedded Content
